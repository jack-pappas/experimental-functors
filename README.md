experimental-functors
=====================

An experiment at expressing functors in F# the .NET type system.

This solution attempts to implement the data structures detailed in Chris Okasaki's *Optimal Purely Functional Priority Queues*
by using static fields of generic types and generic interfaces to encode ML functors.
